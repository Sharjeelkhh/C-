# C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains my journey into learning C++, starting from basic syntax to more advanced concepts. As a cybersecurity student, understanding C++ will help me build foundational programming skills essential for system-level programming, memory management, and understanding security vulnerabilities.

## Repository Structure:

### 1. Basics
Contains simple programs to get familiar with the syntax, data types, input/output handling, and control flow.
- **`hello_world.cpp`**: The classic first program.
- **`variables_and_datatypes.cpp`**: Introduction to variables, constants, and different data types.

### 2. Functions & Loops
Focuses on functions, loops, and recursive programming in C++.
- **`functions_intro.cpp`**: Explains how to define and use functions in C++.
- **`loops_and_conditions.cpp`**: Examples of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, along with conditionals.

### 3. Arrays & Pointers
Covers arrays, pointers, and memory management.
- **`arrays_basics.cpp`**: Demonstrates array usage and manipulation.
- **`pointers_intro.cpp`**: Introduction to pointers and how they work with memory.

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This section covers classes, objects, and the principles of OOP.
- **`oop_basics.cpp`**: A basic introduction to classes and objects in C++.
- **`inheritance.cpp`**: Demonstrates inheritance in C++.

### 5. Advanced Topics
Includes more advanced concepts like file handling, exception handling, and templates.
- **`file_handling.cpp`**: Example of reading from and writing to files.
- **`exception_handling.cpp`**: Introduces error handling with exceptions.
